            Remi is a smart cushion that monitors your sitting duration and posture during long hours of work. It estimates which parts of your body might need some stretching and provides you instructions through a companion app. It's light and easy to carry around too. Remi hopes to help you stay active and productive at the same time.

            <p> Through our conversations with users we learned the importance of a "snooze" feature.
        <strong>Snoozing on the app will also snooze the cushion.</strong>

          <h4>Translate insights from research methods into features</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="project-content">
          <p>We debated a lot about features like group breaks, an activity wall, and a network of products
            in a shared workplace. Though these features were very feasible we did not make them since the user feedback highlighted <strong>user concerns of anonymity and privacy in the workplace on multiple occasions</strong>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Insight 1:</strong>Users WANT to take breaks during long hours of work. But they don’t always REMEMBER to do so.
          Most people need reminders to increase their awareness of taking breaks. </p>
          <div class="leftline">“I was too busy to notice the time. Didn't get up for like 2 hours.”</div>
          <br>

          <p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>Users didn’t want to be disturbed too many times (by a system) while working on something important. Break reminders and activities proposed need to be flexible. </p>
          <div class="leftline">“What if I am taking an important call? I might want to snooze this reminder for now.”</div>
          <br>

          <p><strong>Insight 3: </strong>Social interactions are complex in a shared office space. The designed product should notify users on a personal level without
          disturbing others.</p>
          <div class="leftline">“I have a privacy concern. Will other people know how many breaks I took”</div>

            <p>We prototyped Remi using <strong>Arduino, pressure sensors, vibration motors, fabric, and a woodbox</strong> hiding the breadboard under the chair.
            The final prototyped was created in phases with a simple version which we tested with users and iterated on using feedback received from hallway usability tests.

                  This process introduced me to experience prototyping and the complexity of user testing for furturistic products.  </p>
                  <p>As a team we were very happy with our progress and as we were creating the video we discovered more alarming statistics on sedentary behavior. So remember to stay active and productive!
