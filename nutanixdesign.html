<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="section-header" id="top">Overview</div>
<p style="padding-bottom:30px;">  During a three month internship at Nutanix, San Jose I had the opportunity to explore
  four enterprise UX projects at different phases of the design process. Apart from work, my weeks
  were packed with networking events, bootcamps, and intern outings.

  Here's a quick walkthrough of the highlights my first UX internship!
  </p>

  <div class="section-header">About the Client</div>
  <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
<a href="https://www.nutanix.com/what-we-do/">Nutanix </a>is a software company that makes infrastructure invisible for its users.
They do so by elevating IT to focus on the applications and services that power their business through the power of their Enterprise Cloud Platform.
  </p>


<div class="section-header">My Role</div>
<p style="text-align: center;color:#34515E; font-weight:600;">UX Design Intern<p>
<p>
    Iteratively designed high fidelity prototypes critiqued by engineers, senior UX designers and product managers. Critically redesigned a UX Research plan for the team.
    Ate of lot of chocolate.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
  Due to the NDA agreement instead of discussing the prototypes created or components worked on I will be focussing on the process and tools used. Shortcuts to the projects explored:

            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>To understand our users and explore areas of intervention.</p>
            <p>For me this was a way to quickly learn more about the product from the users directly.</p>

            <p>Representing complex networks spanning buildings condensed all on one screen.</p>
            <p>Allowed me to understand and appreciate the need for simplication of complex systems.</p>

            <p>Ideate on a new feature with PMs, engineers, and designers.</p>
            <p>Helped me go beyond the role of just a designer and talk to multiple key stakeholders.</p>

      <div class="section-header-2" id="user-archetypes"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Creating User Archetypes</div>

      <strong>GOAL: Create a UX Research plan and define user archetypes needed.</strong>
      <br><br>
    Once I took upon the task of analysing interviews transcripts and used Nvivo to open code them, patterns
        started arising.
        We hoped these insights would shed light on <strong>what users like and what they do not understand</strong>.
        Suprisingly,my analysis led to one an unexpected insight.
        <blockquote>
          The interview script needs to be modified. The  project’s end result was changing the project itself.
       </blockquote>
       In the infrasture world, role or position of users and their work aren’t mapped consistently
         through the industry. This led us to also consider modifying the interview scripts and the study plan itself. Instead of just interviewing customers
         we decided to talk to employees who had been in the firm for years and could shed light on issues customers faced in detail.

    <!--  <p>I took the task of analysing these interviews using Nvivo to code the transcripts.
      </p>
      <p>Overall my analysis led to one major insight: The interview script needs to be modified.</p>
      <p>In the infrasture world role or position of users and their work aren’t mapped consistently
        through the university. This led us to also consider modifying the interview scripts and the study plan itself. Instead of just interviewing customers
        we decided to talk to employees who had been in the firm for years and could shed light on issues customers faced in detail. We also updated the end goal to Creating User
        Archetypes, instead of just personas. <p>




        <p> Through usability tests with customers it had been clear that most users did not know much about
        the process of creating a file sever works on Nutanix Node. With no direct competitors this wasn't a
          conventional workflow and was specific to Nutanix Prism.</p>-->

            <div class="section-header-2" id="file-servers" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Redesigning File Servers</div>
        <strong>GOAL: To visually communicate the File server creation process in Nutanix nodes so that users can efficiently
             utilize available resources both in terms of cost and storage. Overall this would help increase user knowledge of the process itself.</strong>
               <br><br>
             <blockquote style="padding-bottom:5%;"> The most challenging part of my
                internship was to create high fidelity prototypes for Nutanix Prism components. I had to redesign a perfectly functional and usable component.</blockquote>
          <p>How did I design a new flow concentrating on visual communication?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Analysed the usability data from .NEXT Nice and DC conferences for previous Visual flows for AFS which had not gone live.</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://maze.design/">maze.design</a> to share the redesigned prototypes and collect comprehensive feedback to use for future iterations. (See screenshots below.)</li>
<li>Conducted expert usability tests with UI and backend engineers of File Servers.</li></ul>

      <div class="section-header-2" id="network-visualizations" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Visualize your Network</div>
      <strong>GOAL: In a three day Hackathon my team and I tried to answer a common yet complex question of the Networks world.
      Which node is not working?</strong>
        <br><br>
      <p>From datacenter admins we learned that error dectection is a time consuming
      task that could range from hours to weeks. Root cause analysis is as scary as the physical datacenters. </p>
      <p>Mapping physical connections in a datacenter to a visual network topology would help reduce some of this complexity.
        Our proposed design used simple shapes (nodes) and red colored dots (errored link source) to indicate overall state of the datacenter. Our deign rationale
        was based on the following
    </p>
    <blockquote> To monitor a complex system where mutiple things can go wrong, an efficient error dectection
    system could be static when all systems are up. In case of an error, it could indicate it through motion,
  color, and concentrated activity in the errored region.  </blockquote>
    <blockquote> Reduce the cognitive load by displaying details in progressive manner. </blockquote>
    <p>Due to the NDA agreement the designs cannot be shared here.</p>

      <div class="section-header-2" id="feature-creation" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Feature Creation</div>

<strong>GOAL: My fourth project involved coming up with a completely new feature to improve engagement between Nutanix Prism and its users.</strong>
  <br><br>
<p>This involved a process of low fidelity sketches, competetive analysis ,calls with the CTO, and a lot of brainstorming. </p>
<blockquote>The most important takeaway for me as an intern was the opportunity to explore this part of the design process, think about business goals vs design goals, and put on my creative hat.</blockquote>
