<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="section-header" id="top">Overview</div>
<p>I explored Pervasive UX Design through the creation of Remi. This process introduced me to experience prototyping and the
  complexity of user testing of furturistic products.
</p>

<div class="section-header">My Role</div>
<p style="text-align: center;color:#34515E; font-weight:600;">Product Designer, UX Researcher<p>
<p> My contributions touched upon all phases of the design process. Particularly delved deeper into designing the
   cultural probes, physical prototypes, and UX reports across four milestones.
</p>

<div class="section-header">Problem</div>
<p>Motivation to create a product like Remi sprouted from the team's own habit of
  working for hours without taking any breaks in front of screens. We then went on to figure out if this really is a burning issue?</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"Too much time spent in a chair could shorten our lives, even if we exercise, according to a study that uses objective measures to find the links between lengthy sitting time and death among middle-aged and older adults." - The New York Times</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Turned out - it is a common problem. Through formative research we narrowed down our problem focus and target users.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
University students and young professionals (specifically those who have a lot of  heads down work)
</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
How can we encourage people to take quick physical activity breaks during long hours of work?
</blockquote>
<br>
<div class="section-header">Solution</div>
<p>Remi is a smart cushion that monitors your sitting duration and posture during long hours of work.
  It estimates which parts of your body might need some stretching and provides you instructions through
  a companion app. It's light and easy to carry around too.

Remi hopes to help you stay active and productive at the same time.</p>

<h6>Shortcuts to highlights from the design process:</h6>

  <br>
  <ul class="shortcuts-list">

            <p style="text-transform:uppercase;">Motivation</p>
            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>The motivation to solve this problem was important in narrowing down the project scope and
              target audience. This helped prototype feasible features of Remi.
            </p>
          </a>
        </li>

        <li class="shortcuts">
          <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#research">
            <p style="text-transform:uppercase;">User Research</p>
            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>Multiple research methods were chosen so that they could capture user behavior at multiple points during the
            user journey. Creating a completely new product especially one that users would use over hours
          created challenges in capturing user sentiment towards it from just one method. </p>
          </a>
        </li>

        <li class="shortcuts">
          <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#features">
            <p style="text-transform:uppercase;">From Insights to Features</p>
            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>Mapping study results to distinct insights helped prototype key features of Remi. </p>

            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>Iterative creation of Remi ensured effective incorporation of user feedback from usability tests and
              ensured validated design decisions. </p>

    </ul>





<div class="section-header-2" id="motivation"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Motivation</div>

<br>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase;">Observations</p>
<p>To observe our target audience we picked popular places in Ann Arbor where we would find our Target
audience working like NCRB, gyms, cafes and study lounges , as seen in the captures below.</p>
<img src="./images/remi_observations.png"  alt="Remi - Motivation">
<br>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase;">Secondary Research</p>
<p>We learned more about office syndrome and how it goes beyond our physical health affecting our mental well being.
</p>
<p style="text-transform:uppercase;">Interviews</p>
<p>From our interviews we found that people like the idea of intergrating exercises in to their
workplace. They often forget to get up and take a break on days around the deadline.
</p>
<blockquote>
  "Sometimes I don't realize I have been sitting for like 3 hours without taking a break."
</blockquote>
<br>
<div class="section-header-2" id="research"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">User Research</div>
<p>To learn more about our target audience and the possible areas for a design solution we used the following methods.
​</p>
<br>
<img src="./images/remi_process_2.png"  alt="Remi - What">
<br><br>
<p>Each study resulted in a few new insights.
  By brainstorming, ideating, prototyping, and talking to our users we further modified those insights.
</p>
<br>
<img src="./images/remi_process_users.png"  alt="Remi - How">
<br><br>
<img src="./images/remi_process_1.png"  alt="Remi - Why">



<div class="section-header-2" id="features"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">From Insights to Features</div>
We extracted three main insights, developed an initial concept, and translated them into features of Remi.
<br><br>
<blockquote> We debated a lot about features like group breaks, an activity wall, and a network of this product
  in a shared workplace.
  Though these features seemed very much feasible, our user feedback highlighted the issue of privacy multiple times.
</blockquote>
<br>

<p><strong>Insight 1:</strong>Users WANT to take breaks during long hours of work. They don’t always REMEMBER to do so.
Most people need reminders to increase their awareness of taking breaks. </p>
<blockquote>“I was too busy to notice the time.”</blockquote>


<p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>Users didn’t want to be disturbed too many times by a system, while working on something important. Break reminders and activities proposed need to be flexible. </p>
<blockquote>“I might want to snooze this reminder for now.”</blockquote>


<p><strong>Insight 3: </strong>Social interactions are complex in a shared office space. The designed product should notify users on a personal level without
disturbing others.</p>
<blockquote>“I have a privacy concern.”</blockquote>

<br>

<div class="section-header-2" id="prototyping"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Prototyping</div>
<p>We prototyped Remi using <strong>Arduino, pressure sensors, vibration motors, fabric, and a woodbox</strong> hiding the breadboard under the chair.
The final prototyped was created in phases with a simple version which we tested with users and iterated on using feedback received from hallway usability tests.
</p>
<img src="./images/remi_prototype.png"  alt="Remi - Prototyping in Phases">
<br>
<div class="section-header" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Reflection</div>

<p>
  Over the semester we have explored various new methods, learned how feedback and user testing for pervasive design is very complex. Some of the questions we could further explore are:
  ​<ul>
  <li>How to keep users interested in our product? How to avoid quick habituation to the notifications?</li>
  <li>What are some other methods to test prodcuts which requires simulating time over hours?</li>
  <li>Explore a replacement for the mobile app. Maybe using augmented reality?</li>
  <li>In the next five years we will have much smarter sensors. How can Remi utilize that?</li>
  ​​</ul>
  As a team we were very happy with our progress and as we were creating the video we discovered more alarming statistics on sedentary behavior. So stay remember to stay active and productive!
